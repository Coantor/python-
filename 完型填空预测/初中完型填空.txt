My best friend, Connie, is two years older than me. We spend a lot of time together.
Connie has long dark brown hair and her eyes are big and round. People say she is [MASK] and looks like a doll. When we go out, people often [MASK] that I am older than her because she is shorter and slimmer.
Connie is positive even when things go [MASK] . Last week she got her examination [MASK] , which were not very good. I thought she was going to be [MASK] .Instead, she simply decided to do better the next time. Then, every day after class, [MASK] teachers are free in their offices, she will ask them for help.
Connie gets on well with others. Everyone in my family [MASK] her, even my younger brother. When you hear her laugh, you will naturally laugh [MASK] . When I feel unhappy, I will talk to Connie and she will make me feel [MASK] .
I think my [MASK] with Connie is very valuable, and I hope we will always be best friends.
